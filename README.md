## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

That was the first challenge that I did on Frontend mentor. I chose an easy 
challenge because, to me, the main point of doing it was not to learn a lot 
of new things. Instead, it was to see how well I would manage to do it on my 
own, without the help of Google or other sources.
